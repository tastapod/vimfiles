# This is my vim setup.
#
# I'm using vundle to keep all my vim plugins in separate directories.
#
# To get started, just move your existing .vim and .vimrc out of the way and
# source this file, or type the following from wherever you want to install:

git clone https://github.com/tastapod/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/vundle
vim +BundleInstall

# To add a new plugin:
#
# - Add Bundle "owner/repo" in ~/.vimrc
# - Run :BundleInstall in vim
